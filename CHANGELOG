Super4PCS-V1.1.1
======================
Minor release update including:
 - fixes in the deployment system and 
 - fix a compilation error when enabling timings, authored by @xinkang 


======================
This release introduces new code structure allowing use as an actual library.

 - Build system
   - Add install target in cmake
   - Save binaries compiled by AppVeyor integration system as Artifacts
 - Demos, scripts and assets
   - assets are now added to the install folder, including downloaded datasets
   - demo scripts have been updated to work directly after installation. Windows batch scripts have been added.
 - Dependencies
   - Chealpix dependency is marked as deprecated: it slows down the approach and reduce it's robustness. Consequently, Chealpix is still built in CI but not tested.
 - Devel
   - Update include directive relatively to super4pcs root dir.
   - Add silent mode in matcher to avoid unwanted logging on standard output. This is implemented by adding a visitor in the matcher main loop, and set it as a logger in the Super4pcs main app.

Super4PCS-V1.0.0-alpha
======================
